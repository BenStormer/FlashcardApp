## Lab 4

### App Description
This is a simple flashcard app that allows the user to create and delete cards, cycle through a deck, and click (or hide) multiple choice answers. When creating or editing cards, if a user does not fill out all the required fields an error message will pop up. Additionally, it has been stylized with animations and custom textviews. This app serves as Lab 4 for CodePath's Intro to Mobile App Development - Android course.
